      FHIR CodeableConcept information: https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept
      A CodeableConcept represents a value that is usually supplied by providing a reference to one or more terminologies 
      or ontologies but may also be defined by the provision of text. This is a common pattern in healthcare data.
      
      More than one code may be used in CodeableConcept. The concept may be coded multiple times in different code systems 
      (or even multiple times in the same code systems, where multiple forms are possible, such as with SNOMED CT). 
      Each coding (also referred to as a 'translation') is a representation of the concept as described above and may 
      have slightly different granularity due to the differences in the definitions of the underlying codes. 
      There is no meaning associated with the ordering of coding within a CodeableConcept. A typical use of CodeableConcept is to 
      send the local code that the concept was coded with, and also one or more translations to publicly defined code systems such 
      as LOINC or SNOMED CT. Sending local codes is useful and important for the purposes of debugging and integrity auditing. 
      
      Using Text in CodeableConcept
      The text is the representation of the concept as entered or chosen by the user, and which most closely represents the intended 
      meaning of the user or concept. Very often the text is the same as a display of one of the codings. One or more of the codings may 
      be flagged as the user selected code - the code or concept that the user actually selected directly. Note that in all but a few cases, 
      only one of the codings may be flagged as the coding.userSelected = true - the code or concept that the user actually selected directly. 
      If more than one code is marked as user selected, this means the user explicitly chose multiple codes. When none of the 
      coding elements is marked as user selected, the text (if present) is the preferred source of meaning. 
      
      A free text only representation of the concept without any coding elements is permitted if there is no appropriate 
      code and only free text is available (and not prohibited by the implementation).
